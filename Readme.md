Trying to learn backend 

cmd executed:
node -v
npm init
git init
git add .
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:GauravKaushik1/gklearn.git
git push -u origin main

images storage and kept temporary in the file
make .gitkeep file to keep the temporary files in use currently

.gitignore generator may also be used for making sure some files are never uploaded to github

add "type": "module", to package.json for using the modular asynchronous code approach instead of common js


install dev dependency of node mon so that we do not have to start/stop the server for refresh or use --watch may be an alternative

env is not easily import using the module format
